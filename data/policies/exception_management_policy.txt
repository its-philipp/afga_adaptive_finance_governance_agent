EXCEPTION MANAGEMENT AND LEARNING POLICY

This policy defines how exceptions are handled and how the system learns from human decisions.

1. EXCEPTION TYPES
- Temporary exception: One-time override for specific circumstances
- Recurring exception: Pattern-based rule for similar future transactions
- Policy gap: Situation not covered by existing policies

2. EXCEPTION APPROVAL AUTHORITY
- Low-value exceptions (under $5,000): Manager approval
- High-value exceptions ($5,000-$15,000): Director approval
- Policy exceptions (over $15,000): VP approval

3. LEARNING FROM EXCEPTIONS
When a human approves an exception:
- System captures the rationale
- Similar patterns are identified
- Memory is updated with learned rule
- Future similar transactions apply the learned exception

4. EXCEPTION REVIEW CYCLE
All exceptions are reviewed quarterly to:
- Confirm validity
- Update policies if needed
- Remove obsolete exceptions
- Measure exception frequency trends

5. EXCEPTION DOCUMENTATION
Each exception must include:
- Business justification
- Risk assessment
- Approver identification
- Duration (temporary vs permanent)
- Review date

The goal is continuous learning to reduce human intervention over time while maintaining compliance.
