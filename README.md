## Overview

Adaptive Finance Governance Agent (AFGA) is a production-ready, multi-agent compliance assistant for finance operations. It automates invoice auditing, enforces policy adherence, and learns from human reviewers via adaptive memory so the Human Correction Rate (H-CR) drops over time.

The system now ships with **real HTTP-based A2A communication** between agents, **MCP resources/tools** for shared knowledge, end-to-end observability, and a Streamlit UI tailored for demos.

## Architecture

AFGA runs three specialized LangGraph agents connected through a hybrid protocol stack:

- **TAA – Transaction Auditor Agent** (client): orchestrates the workflow, scores risk, and calls downstream agents through the A2A protocol.
- **PAA – Policy Adherence Agent** (server): exposes an A2A executor that consults MCP policy resources + RAG to evaluate compliance.
- **EMA – Exception Manager Agent** (server): processes HITL feedback, updates adaptive memory through MCP tools, and feeds improvements back into PAA.

**Key technologies**
- LangGraph state machines for each agent
- A2A HTTP/JSON-RPC for cross-agent delegation
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) for policies, adaptive memory, and KPI tooling
- FastAPI gateway, Streamlit front-end, Langfuse observability
- SQLite (local) with upgrade path to Databricks Delta for persistence

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [`docs/HYBRID_A2A_MCP.md`](docs/HYBRID_A2A_MCP.md) for full diagrams.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- OpenRouter API key (or compatible LLM provider)

### Setup & Run
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync --extra all

# Copy environment template and add secrets (no keys are committed)
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Start FastAPI backend
uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload

# In a second terminal start Streamlit UI
streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py
```
Navigate to http://localhost:8501 to explore the workflow dashboard.

## Flagship Capabilities

### 🤖 Multi-Agent Orchestration
- TAA delegates to PAA/EMA over authenticated A2A HTTP calls.
- Each agent exposes LangGraph nodes with typed state transitions.

### 🧠 Adaptive Memory
- HITL feedback creates learned exceptions persisted via MCP tools.
- Context Retention Score (CRS) and Human Correction Rate (H-CR) track learning effectiveness.

### 📄 Document Intelligence
- Upload PDF or image receipts for extraction and validation.
- Zero-width characters are normalized for clean UI rendering.

### 🛡️ AI Governance & Auditability
- Input/output governance, redaction, and KPI tracking.
- Langfuse captures traces, spans, and LLM generations.

### 📊 KPIs & Dashboarding
- Streamlit visualizes KPIs (H-CR, CRS, ATAR), learned exceptions, and RAG transparency.

Highlights:
- Home pages introduce the AFGA architecture and provide quick links into the workflow demo.
- Transaction submission and review screens demonstrate the A2A delegation, policy compliance reasoning, and adaptive memory surfacing.
- Workflow, KPI, memory, and policy views visualize the hybrid A2A + MCP protocols and system health.
- AI Governance pages showcase Langfuse traces, redaction logs, and compliance safeguards.
